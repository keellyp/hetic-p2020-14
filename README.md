## Precisions 📝
- I used the [BEM](http://getbem.com/naming/) naming class convention.
- For the CSS, I added [CSSComb](https://github.com/csscomb/csscomb.js) to format and sort our code.
- For the Javascript, I used [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) and code in ES6. 
- I liked to use [gitmoji](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji/) when I commited to identify quickly the purpose of the commit 
- Everytime I could, I followed the rules of [FrontEndChecklist](https://frontendchecklist.io/)
