This is a school project based on the Oculus Rift website. It is a front-end development project only built with HTML, CSS and JS. We wanted to create a real experience in our website around the Rift.

- For the Javascript, we used [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) and code in ES6. 
- We liked to use [gitmoji](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji/) when we commited to identify quickly the purpose of the commit 
- Everytime we could, we followed the rules of [FrontEndChecklist](https://frontendchecklist.io/)
