# Oculus Rift
This is a school project based on the Oculus Rift website. It is a front-end development project only built with HTML, CSS and JS. We wanted to create a real experience in our website around the Rift.

## Precisions 
- We use the [BEM](http://getbem.com/naming/) naming class convention.
- For the CSS, we add [CSSComb](https://github.com/csscomb/csscomb.js) to format and sort our code.
- For the Javascript, we use [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) and code in ES6. 
- We like to use [gitmoji](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji/) when we commit to identify quickly the purpose of the commit
